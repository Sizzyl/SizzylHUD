# How To Install SizzylHUD
Sizzyl's Team Fortress 2 Heads Up Display (TF2 HUD) is installed like any other custom HUD. All you have to do is hit the green code button, then 'Download ZIP'. From here, all you need to do is unzip this file with any unzipping tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and then drag that final folder into your Team Fortress 2 custom folder. To get to this folder, just right click TF2 in your steam library and then right click it and hit 'properties', go to 'installed files', then hit 'browse'. From here, if you go into the 'tf' folder you will see a 'custom' folder where the unzipped form of this HUD will go into.

# This doesn't look like Sizzyl's game in the videos!!!
That is likely because of one of the many commands in my autoexecs or something from a mod I use. You can download those from [my non-HUD repo](https://github.com/Sizzyl/SizzylTF2).

## Credits/Inspirations

## Known Issues/Planned Features
- Meet your match screen is gone? (the thing that shows up when game starts showing players)
- No respawn timer unless you reload hud
- In-Game customization options, such as moving elements to corner, moving chat position, caption toggle, 'streamer mode', etc.
- Single click between backpack/loadout
- Single click to access ccommunity servers/create a server
- Single clicks for each gamemode? not sure how possible this is haven't seen it done before
- Borders in item inspect similar to KBNHud
- K/D/A in semi-weird places, will move later
- Be able to turn character in tab menu (similar to on character select in middle mann already), this was done in coolhud
- Transparent background on backpack/loadouts (like in half life 2 hud) <- will have to see this in action, not sure if it looks as good as i'd think
- Written instructions in the far corner of loadout screen giving instructions on the cool custom stuff (like in center hud) is nice
- Button for 'sound fix (snd_restart)'
- Button for 'invisible player fix (record fix; stop)
- Button for 'demoui'/'demoui2'
- Button for 'vr mode toggle (cl_first_person_uses_world_modÂ­el 1/0)' [fixes demoman sheilds]
- Button for mastercomms quickplay is a neat addition if it can look nice somehow
