# How To Install SizzylHUD
Sizzyl's Team Fortress 2 Heads Up Display (TF2 HUD) is installed like any other custom HUD. All you have to do is hit the green code button, then 'Download ZIP'. From here, all you need to do is unzip this file with any unzipping tool such as [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) and then drag that final folder into your Team Fortress 2 custom folder. To get to this folder, just right click TF2 in your steam library and then right click it and hit 'properties', go to 'installed files', then hit 'browse'. From here, if you go into the 'tf' folder you will see a 'custom' folder where the unzipped form of this HUD will go into.

## This doesn't look like Sizzyl's game in the videos!!!
That is likely because of one of the many commands in my autoexecs or something from a mod I use. You can download those from [my non-HUD repo](https://github.com/Sizzyl/SizzylTF2).

## Some HUD Features
- Stock TF2-like UI
- Easily navigatable menus, such as single click class swaps on loadout screen
- Centralized essential in-game HUD elements while keeping extra info to the edges of the screen
- Friend list toggle
- Custom captions that are nicely colored and competitive-centered
- Press 'A' and 'D' to navigate quickly through backpack
- On loadout screen, hold 'shift' to move character, hold 'right click' to zoom in/out character, hold 'left click' to rotate character, and hold 'left-control' to change lighting
- Split tab menu with focus on KDA and being able to still see game while tabbed
- Various additional menu buttons for fixes/toggles (such as VRmode toggle)
- Higher quality class select images
- Lifetime stats on main menu
- Chat in top left corner with build menu in middle left to stay out of your immediate vision
- Easy to read teammate health/name info at top of screen
- Easier to read voice chat names / profile pics
- More smaller changes that aren't documented here

## Known Issues/Planned Features
- In-Game customization options, such as moving elements to corner, moving chat position, caption toggle, 'streamer mode', etc.
- Single click to access ccommunity servers/create a server
- Single clicks for each gamemode? not sure how possible this is haven't seen it done before
- Borders in item inspect similar to KBNHud
- K/D/A in semi-weird places, will move later
- Be able to turn character in tab menu (similar to on character select in middle mann already), this was done in coolhud
